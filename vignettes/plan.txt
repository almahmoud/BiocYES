Here's the plan of our encounters over the next few weeks.

# Topics to illuminate data science in cancer research

## Cancer in the world around us

- What are rates of cancer incidence or mortality in nearby communities?  Around the USA?
- How do we form maps of cancer incidence or treatment practices?  What
makes maps interesting and useful?
- How do we appraise trends in cancer incidence?
- How do regional trends in cancer incidence help us to reason about preventive solutions?

## Cancer in the human body

- What are the body sites most commonly afflicted by cancer?
- How do we define risks for cancers at specific body sites?
- Are cancer preventive strategies and treatments inherently "site-specific"?  Are
there any approaches that may work for cancer wherever in the body it occurs?

## Finding treatments for cancer

- What are clinical trials?
- What are the classes of drugs considered useful for treating cancer,
and how does data science address the tasks of drug discovery and optimization
of treatment protocols?

## Illuminating cancer biology

- What are somatic mutations?  How do they occur, and how do they drive tumor formation?
- What is gene expression?  How are patterns of expression identified as playing
roles in cancer progression and treatment?


## When our cancers aren't well-researched

- How is data science mobilized by patient groups who find that there is very
limited research conducted on their particular conditions?
