# Overview

The BiocYES package collects software and documentation for an introduction
to data science in the domain of cancer biology, epidemiology, and treatment.
In 2022 there are five main modules covered:

- Cancer maps
- Cancer anatomy
- Cancer clinical trials
- Molecular biology of cancer: data science considerations
- Patient-initiated research

# Cancer map concepts

## Drawing maps with R

```{r lkd1}
library(BiocYES)
mass_map()
```

Exercise:  Look at the code for `mass_map` and change it to 
produce a map of Rhode Island.

## Tabulating cancer statistics with geographic metadata

### Some basic statistics by "metropolitan statistical area (MSA)"

```{r lkd2}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
data(woncan_meta)
cat(woncan_meta, sep="\n")
data(woncan)
littab = woncan |> select(MSA, `Cancer Sites`, Age.Adjusted.Rate) |> as.data.frame()
datatable(littab, options=list(lengthMenu=c(5,10,15,20)))
```

Exercise: Use the search input widget to limit focus to prostate cancer.  How many
MSAs do not report the age adjusted rate for this cancer?  Sort the rates in
decreasing order.  What is the MSA with second-highest rate of prostate cancer?  What
is the rate there?

### Representing locations

```{r lkd3}
library(sf)
data(us_county_geo)
us_county_geo[1,] |> select(state, county, geometry)
```

### Exercise

Join the location data to the `woncan` statistics.  Plot the
rates for prostate cancer at the geographic locations where
they were recorded.

As an example, look at the code for `cancer_map_usa`, which
produces:
```{r domaca}
cancer_map_usa()
```


# Cancer anatomy 

## TCGA sites

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) collects data on a number
of cancers defined by anatomic site.  The 37 sites available are:

```{r lktcga}
library(TCGAutils)
data(diseaseCodes)
datatable(diseaseCodes, options=list(lengthMenu=c(5,10,15,20)))
```

## Oncotree hierarchy

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center manages an
interactive tumor-type navigation system called oncotree.

A snapshot is:

Exercise: Use the oncotree API and operations on the JSON returned
from `http://oncotree.mskcc.org/api/tumorTypes/tree` to produce
a searchable table with columns indicating tissue, parent, UMLS tag,
and NCI code for all tumor types.

## Tumor anatomy: imaging of glioblastoma

# Cancer clinical trials

## Concepts of equipoise, randomization, and simulation

For an overview of very basic considerations of
probability and bias in the context of shuffling
cards, see `vignette("play4YES")`.

## Finding clinical trials: clinicaltrials.gov

Here is a snapshot from a page at the NIH reference for
clinical trials (worldwide):

It is necessary to know what "CTCs" means (circulating tumor cells)
to make sense of this.

## Survival curves for the comparison of treatments

## Quality-adjusted survival time concepts

# Molecular biology of cancer: data science perspectives

# Patient-initiated research
