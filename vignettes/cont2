## TCGA sites

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) collects data on a number
of cancers defined by anatomic site.  The 37 sites available are:

```{r lktcga}
library(TCGAutils)
data(diseaseCodes)
datatable(diseaseCodes, options=list(lengthMenu=c(5,10,15,20)))
```

## Oncotree hierarchy

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center manages an
interactive tumor-type navigation system called oncotree.

A snapshot is:

Exercise: Use the oncotree API and operations on the JSON returned
from `http://oncotree.mskcc.org/api/tumorTypes/tree` to produce
a searchable table with columns indicating tissue, parent, UMLS tag,
and NCI code for all tumor types.

## Concepts of equipoise, randomization, and simulation

For an overview of very basic considerations of
probability and bias in the context of shuffling
cards, see `vignette("play4YES")`.

## Finding clinical trials: clinicaltrials.gov

Here is a snapshot from a page at the NIH reference for
clinical trials (worldwide):

It is necessary to know what "CTCs" means (circulating tumor cells)
to make sense of this.
