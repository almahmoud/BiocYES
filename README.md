# BiocYES

Software and documentation for a [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative 
project](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-sustaining-a-worldwide-community-of-genome-data-scientists/)
on Bioconductor's diversity and inclusiveness with [DFCI YES for CURE](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/yes-for-cure/).  

Our primary concern is to develop open resources for training high school and undergraduate students in cancer data science.

Topics to be addressed

- Mapping cancer rates
- Cancer anatomy
- Cancer clinical trials
- Molecular biology of cancers
- Patient-initiated research on cancer

These topics will be addressed in Jupyter notebooks, R markdown documents, and "shiny apps", to instruct in
both the subject matter of cancer data science, and the operation
of computational tools to solve problems in these areas.
